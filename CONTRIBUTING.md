# Creating a release

This project uses [cargo-release](https://github.com/sunng87/cargo-release) for release management.

To get or update the tool, run: `cargo install cargo-release --force`

To create a release, given the appropriate permissions and certificates, you should use
its CLI, create a `--dry-run`, verify inclusion of the expected changes, then publish.
